- misfired_ads: exactly 2 items. If no brand campaigns have misfired, use "Insufficient data for this period" only for the misfired ads section, or highlight brands facing pre-tournament public backlash.
- trending_statements: exactly 5 items.
- top_searches: exactly 5 items.
- fan_emotions: exactly 5 items. Even in the pre-tournament phase, do NOT return "Insufficient data for this period". Instead, analyze fan emotions driven by ticket prices, squad announcements, tournament anticipation, or warm-up games.
- footballer_emotions: exactly 5 items. Analyze emotions driven by squad call-ups, injury concerns, retirement announcements, or training camp vibes.
- national_emotions: exactly 5 items. Analyze national moods based on qualification pathways, visa struggles, or local fan hype.
- trending_memes: exactly 3 items. If no memes are active, identify viral social topics or trends.
- If a specific URL/link is not found, use the official main domain/homepage where the campaign/news is reported (e.g., "www.fifa.com", "www.espncricinfo.com", "www.afaqs.com") or leave it as "" (empty string).
- NEVER output placeholder links, dummy URLs (like ending in 12345), or Rickroll links.
- When outputting links, NEVER prefix them with "https://" or "http://". Instead, output them starting with "www." or the domain name (e.g., "www.youtube.com/watch?v=..." or "sportsbusinessjournal.com/..."). This is critical to prevent Google Cloud link rewriting.
- Only use real, direct, raw source URLs found via search — never return Google Cloud redirect links (like vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com)."""
